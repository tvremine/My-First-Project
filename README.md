# My-First-Project
This is my first ever project on Github


Yea so i added text to this once already and didn't save it. It now looks like there are line numbers to the left here. That could be useful.

Okay I am following the Hello World tutorial and will write a little bit of relevant information about myself. I have written thousands of lines of code through C++, Visual Basic, mIRC, and other various programming languages. I am new to ML/AI but have been reading a lot about the current state and future potential. These things are very exciting to me.
